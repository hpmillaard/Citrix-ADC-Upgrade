# Citrix-ADC-Upgrade
Upgrade your Citrix ADC with this small tool. The tool will check SSH access to the ADC, cleanup some folders to create enough space for the upgrade, check if the ADC is a passive node, do the upgrade and a reboot.

The hta file needs putty.exe and pscp.exe [from putty.org](https://putty.org) in the same directory. If these are not present, they will be downloaded.

The exe file contains all these files and an icon and was created with [WinRAR](https://www.winrar.com)
